# UART-MSG-Control
This system uses the UART communication protocol to send messages via a Bluetooth module. These messages allow the system to control an LED (on/off), operate a servo motor, adjust RGB colors, and write text on an LCD display. The system is designed to be expandable, enabling the addition and control of more features through similar messages.
